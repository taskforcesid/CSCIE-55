The solution to assignment 1 required the development of the following 
methods in the elevator class:
 
Elevator(): The constructor to the elevator enabled the initialization of
the required variables for the project. It sets the initial number of passengers 
to zero, intializes the floors array, sets the current floor to 1, and the directon 
of movement to up.

move(): the move method enabled the elevator class to move up and down between floors
depending on the direction of movement, offloads the passengers on their designated
floors, and changes the direction of movement once the elevator reaches the top floor
or the bottom floor.

boardPassenger(int destinationFloor): the boardPassenger method accepts the floor destination
of a passenger, then increments the values for the destination floor and the number of passengers
in the elevator.

toString(): toString method returns a String value that has the elevator's current
floor and the number of passengers in the elevator.
